    <h1> About Charles </h1>
    <p> I am 17 years old and just recently graduated highschool early! Throughout my highschool expirience I realize how much I 
    like to solve problems. I also realized just how much I like working with others and communicating as a team. I also was captain on
    the football team so being a team is something that has really stuck with me!</p> 
    <p> I believe Thinkful is the program for me because software engineering is something that has always interested me. My sister is also
    a big inspiration in my life and she completed the Thinkful course and says that she loved it. Another reason why I think that Thinkful
    is the place for me is becasue of how mcuh I have learned just in this short amount of time throughout the prep course!</p>
