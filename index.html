      <h3>Why Thinkful?</h3>
      <article>
        <p>I recently graduated high school early, and throughout my experience I realized how much I like to solve problems and work with others as a team.</p>
        <p>Software engineering has always interested me, and my sister completed the Thinkful course and says that she loved it. Another reason why I think that Thinkful is the place for me is because of how much I have learned just in this short amount of time throughout the prep course!</p>
